# rust-book-exercises-solutions

My own solutions and commentaries for the exercises of the book The Rust Programming Language, written by Carol Nichols and Steve Klabnik.

This book covers several subjects of Rust: from the first steps in the language to the differences to other languages and to the main features of Rust.
All chapters (except from the first two) has some exercises that we try to solve in this repository.

The writing is fantastic, the exercises are quite a challenge and there is much much information about programming and the language throughout the book, so I highly recommend this one.

The book is avalaible for free in https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/, but can also be bought in paper version.
